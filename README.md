# Algebrator

A tool to manipulate mathamatical expressions, inspired by the paper [Interactive Algebra Manipulation](https://github.com/trebor/algebrator/blob/master/resources/shuffle.pdf) by [Geoffrey Irving](https://github.com/girving). Checkout the [prototype](https://trebor.github.io/algebrator), which doesn't do very much at the moment.
